# TODO for Cold Storage Unit Management Interface

## Tasks
- [x] Modify cold-storage-dashboard.html: Change the requests list to display farmer requests with radio buttons for selecting one request at a time, remove the modal, and add a form below the list for entering condition details
- [x] Update app.js: Modify the cold storage dashboard logic to handle radio button selection (store selected request ID), and update the form submission to use the selected request ID for updating condition
- [ ] Test the interface: Run the app, login as cold storage, select a farmer, enter condition, save, then check farmer dashboard to verify condition is viewable
